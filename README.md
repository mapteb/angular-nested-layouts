# Angular Nested Layouts

This project is a helloworld style implementation of an Angular v20 app that uses dynamic nested layouts like in this [demo](https://mapteb.github.io/angular-nested-layouts/).

## Features 

Clicking Page 1, and Page 2 loads corresponding page contents in the main layout.

Clicking Page 3, Page 4, and Page 5 loads corresponding page contents in a nested layout.

Page 1 thru Page 4 links are routed using routerLink.

Page 5 link is routed programmatically.

Routing to corresponding layouts is accomplished using the Angular's router-outlet and named router-outlet features.
